# Introduction
**About this document**

Thank you for your interest in certifying your IoT device(s) for Azure Certified for IoT program. This document provides an overview of how device manufacturers can onboard to the program, submit their device(s) to certification, and requirements of three classes of IoT device(s) that the program supports to certify: IoT devices, IoT Starter Kits and IoT Edge devices. 

## First step

Device manufacturers can register as a partner for onboarding on Device Catalog [here](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/register). Registration email should be either an organizational account (linked to Active Directory) or a Microsoft account. If you are unsure of what this is, please visit [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/work-accounts-faq/) for more information. You can create a Microsoft account [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjHldWn46DPAhUCzWMKHc3dD8EQFggjMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Faccount&usg=AFQjCNEwDuHv5lREt0aGzy5CPD4IR4fNSA&sig2=gfwoKMfm6-YY8bAGEnEHNA). 

Once the registration is done successfully partner can submit the device for certification via [Partner Dashboard](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/devices). Once you submit your device(s), we will review your submission and provide you with the appropriate instructions that you need to follow.

## IoT Device Class

There are three primary classes of IoT devices that we are certifying against, and each has different set of requirements. 

### IoT Devices Certification

Microsoft is certifying against the bi-directional connectivity between the IoT devices and Azure IoT Hub. This is the most common IoT device class. 

**Process:** 

-   *Requirement :* Partner pick the OS and programming language, and relevant SDK are shared to the partner based on that partner runs the test cases and share the results. 
-   *Certifying Criteria :* Device is certify based on the screenshots, log files and the get started document shared by the partners. 
-   Details guidelines can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/tree/master/iotcertification)

### IoT Starter Kit Certification 

IoT Starter Kit comprised of the certified IoT device and sensors/actuators/cables/breadboard etc. The IoT Starter Kit allows Solution builders to customize the hardware configurations based on existing certified IoT device for PoC or commercial projects. Microsoft is certifying against the bi-directional connectivity between the IoT Starter Kit and Azure IoT Hub. 

**Process:**

-   *Requirement :* The kit must include all items that are required for the kit to be functional:
-   Partner should have a device that is Azure Certified for IoT along with Sensors/Actuators/Cables/Breadboard connected to the device and laptop/keyboard.
-   *Certifying Criteria :* Kit is certify based on the screenshots, log files and the get started document shared by the partners. 
-   Details guidelines can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/kits/iotcertification/iot_certification_kit.md).

### IoT Edge Devices Certification 

IoT Edge device provides higher quality standards than the IoT devices and IoT Starter Kit. Connectivity to Azure IoT Hub is pre-requisite and additionally, Microsoft is certifying against IoT Edge runtime pre-installation and basic device management capabilities to simplify the development of IoT solutions on IoT Edge devices.

**Process:**

-   *Requirement :* Partner pick the OS and instruction set is shared to the partner , partner needs to run the test cases for Edge Runtime and Device Management and share the screenshots of result at first and then ship the device to Microsoft
-   *Pre-Requisite :* Device should have the Edge Runtime and Client components installed when device is shipped to Microsoft 
-   *Certifying Criteria :* Device is certified based on the screenshots, log files shared, and results are validated on actual physical device. Partner need to send the Hardware and the software manuals and get started document for the device 
-   Details guidelines can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/iotcertification/iotedge/iotedge_getstarted.md)
